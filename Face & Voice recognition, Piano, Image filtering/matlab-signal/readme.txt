- In this project, we implemented a program with MATLAB which gets an image as argument and
applies given filters on this image.
- You can execute the program with typing “ >> imageFiltering(‘image_name’) ” to the main
command window of the MATLAB.
- Also, we constructed filter.bb function for filtering the image and contranst_enhance.m function for
enhancing the contrast of the image.
